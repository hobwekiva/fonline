# FOnline open source

This is an open source implementation of the Fallout Online released under GPL.

# Issues
* Client doesn't compile on linux yet since it uses DirectX.
* I have not even tried compiling NPC editor and Map editor.

# Compilation on Linux and other Unixes:
   
    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    make

# Compilation on Windows:
Use cmake-gui, hopefully it works. If it doesn't, try using the premake makefile.
